# Linux PowerToys
![Hero image for Linux PowerToys](./HeroImage.png)


_ðŸš§ Get Microsoft's PowerToys utilities and much more to Linux world! This project is currently in a very early stage of development. Right now it is a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of the concept._

**Linux PowerToys**, is an open-source initiative aimed at bringing the utilities of Microsoft PowerToys and more to the Linux world. However, this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft in any way. It is not a porting effort but a complete reimplementation from scratch. The original Microsoft PowerToys relies on Windows dependencies, and therefore, a porting process is not feasible.

## Utilities

Linux PowerToys brings a set of utilities to tune and streamline Linux experience for greater productivity.

| **Awake**             | Keep the computer awake without having to manage its power & sleep settings. This behaviour can be helpful when running time-consuming tasks, ensuring that the computer does not go to sleep or turn off its screens.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **FancyZones**        | Window management utility that organizes and snaps windows into efficient layouts to enhance workflow speed and quickly restore layouts. FancyZones allows you to define a set of zone positions to use as destinations for windows on the desktop. When dragging a window into a zone or using the associated shortcut key, the window is resized and repositioned to fit that zone. [Learn more...](./doc/FANCY_ZONES.md) |
