We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss with the owners of this repository before making a change. To do so, create a new issue.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/domferr/Linux-PowerToys/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv2 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv2 License](https://github.com/domferr/Linux-PowerToys/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can. Try to write a sample code that *anyone* with a base setup can run to reproduce the bug
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
